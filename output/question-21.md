Imbalanced datasets: The authors acknowledge that the datasets used were imbalanced, which can pose a challenge for accurate prediction. Computational time: They noted that some SBAs can be computationally expensive, especially for larger projects.

# Research 19

The paper acknowledges that MOFES has a higher computational cost than filter-based feature selection methods, though lower than most wrapper based methods. The choice of hyperparameters for the classifiers is not extensively explored. The impact of MOFES on model interpretability is not investigated in this study.

They highlighted the challenge of data dependency in machine learning models for fault prediction. As projects evolve, changes in size, domain, and architecture can significantly affect the model's performance.

# Research 21

Yes, the paper mentions the challenge of class imbalance in software defect datasets and the importance of considering cost-sensitivity. It also emphasizes the need for more focus on data preprocessing and feature selection.

# Research 22

Yes, the paper discusses challenges related to model complexity and the cost of misclassifying faulty instances, particularly with non-transparent models. It also points to the need for incorporating more information beyond static code metrics, such as inter-module relations.

# Research 23

They mention the threat to generalizability due to focusing on a single Java-based project (Android). They also highlight the potential influence of software size on defect prediction and the need to investigate this further.

# Research 24

Data quality and noise are acknowledged as challenges in software defect prediction.
