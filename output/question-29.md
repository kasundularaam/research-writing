# QUESTION
Were any comparisons made between traditional software metrics and more advanced or domain-specific metrics?

# Research 1

Not explicitly compared. The paper focuses on three broad classes of metrics (code, network, and process) without delving into specific metric types within each class.

# Research 2

The study focuses on commonly used software metrics and does not compare them with more advanced or domain-specific metrics.

# Research 3

The study focuses on traditional CK metrics and doesn't compare them to more advanced metrics.

# Research 4

    - The study uses traditional software metrics; no comparison is made with more advanced or domain-specific metrics.

# Research 5

The study focuses on traditional object-oriented software metrics and does not compare them with more advanced or domain-specific metrics.

# Research 6

The study directly uses ASTs as input, bypassing the need for traditional software metrics.

# Research 7

Comparison with advanced metrics is not performed.

# Research 8

No comparison provided.

# Research 9

The paper briefly mentions different categories of metrics, but it doesn't delve into a detailed comparison between traditional and more advanced metrics.

# Research 10

No explicit comparison was made, though the study uses commonly employed traditional metrics.

# Research 11

No, such comparisons are not made in this study.

# Research 12

No, the paper does not delve into comparing different types of software metrics. It uses a set of 21 commonly used method-level metrics without further discussion on their selection or individual relevance.

# Research 13

The study primarily focused on traditional software metrics like LOC, McCabe, and Halstead metrics. It briefly mentioned the potential use of more advanced metrics like requirement metrics and data on intermodule relations, but did not perform a direct comparison.

# Research 14

Not explicitly discussed.

# Research 15

No, the paper doesn't make this comparison.

# Research 16

The study uses a mix of traditional (McCabe, Halstead, LOC) and object-oriented metrics, but no explicit comparison is made.

# Research 17

Not explicitly compared.

# Research 18

No, the study focused on traditional OO metrics.

# Research 19

The paper doesn't delve into comparisons between traditional and more advanced metrics. It uses established metric suites.

# Research 20

No, the focus was solely on McCabe metrics.

# Research 21

No, the study focuses on traditional McCabe and Halstead metrics.

# Research 22

While the paper mentions different types of metrics used (OO metrics, Halstead metrics, etc.), it doesn't explicitly compare traditional and more advanced metrics.

# Research 23

No, the study focuses solely on change metrics (SCM) and doesn't compare them to other types of metrics.

# Research 24

The paper doesn't explicitly compare traditional software metrics with more advanced or domain-specific metrics. It focuses on using static code attributes commonly found in the Promise repository.

# Research 25

No comparisons were made between different types of metrics. The study used a combination of established static code and process metrics.

# Research 26

No explicit comparisons between traditional and advanced/domain-specific metrics were made. However, the use of both code-level metrics (MDP) and change-level metrics (JIT) offers some insight into different types of metrics.

# Research 27

The study primarily focuses on traditional software metrics. LOCQ, derived from static analysis, can be considered a more advanced metric, but the paper does not explicitly compare its effectiveness to traditional metrics.

# Research 28

The study focused only on traditional object-oriented metrics. No comparisons were made with more advanced or domain-specific metrics.

# Research 29

No comparison made.

# Research 30

No comparisons were made between traditional and advanced software metrics.
