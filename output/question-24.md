# Research 10

No, transfer learning or domain adaptation was not mentioned.

# Research 11

No, transfer learning or domain adaptation is not discussed.

# Research 12

Transfer learning is implicitly involved in the **TNB (Transfer Naive Bayes)** method, which is included in the comparisons. However, the paper's focus is not on evaluating or improving transfer learning methods.

# Research 13

No, transfer learning or domain adaptation was not considered in this study. It was focused on within-project defect prediction.
