# QUESTION
Were any ensemble methods used? If so, which ones?

# Research 1

Yes, ensemble methods are a core part of the study:
* **Traditional:** Bagging and Boosting are included as base learners.
* **Imbalanced:** Many of the imbalanced techniques are based on bagging or boosting in combination with resampling methods.

# Research 2

Yes, the study heavily focuses on ensemble methods:
- Majority Voting
- Total Accuracy (TA)-based Weighted Averaging
- Evolutionary Programming (EP) based ensemble (proposed)

# Research 3

No ensemble methods were used.

# Research 4

   -  Yes, the state-of-the-art ensemble method (STSE) from Tong et al. (2018) is used for comparison. The excerpt doesn't give the full details of STSE.

# Research 5

No ensemble methods were used in this study.

# Research 6

Not used in this study, but suggested as a future research direction to address hyperparameter instability.

# Research 7

Yes, the proposed Average Probability Ensemble (APE) is an ensemble method, combining multiple base learners: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Weighted Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

# Research 8

Not used.

# Research 9

Yes, Bagging was used as an ensemble method for SVM.

# Research 10

Yes,
* Random Forest (an ensemble of decision trees)
* Adaboost (another ensemble method)

# Research 11

No ensemble methods were used.

# Research 12

Yes, the following ensemble methods were included in the comparisons:

* BAG (Bagging)
* DTB (Double Transfer Boosting)

# Research 13

The study used Random Forests, which is an ensemble learning method.

# Research 14

No

# Research 15

Yes, the paper includes these ensemble methods:

* Random Forest

# Research 16

Yes, Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble method used in the study.

# Research 17

Yes, Bagging and Voting

# Research 18

Yes, both Logitboost and Adaboost are ensemble learning methods. Additionally, several of the search-based algorithms (like GFS-AB, GFS-LB) incorporate boosting within their framework.

# Research 19

No, the paper doesn't explicitly employ ensemble methods in its proposed approach.

# Research 20

No, ensemble methods weren't used in this study.

# Research 21

No, the study focuses on a single ANN optimized by the ABC algorithm.

# Research 22

No, the focus is on Bayesian Network classifiers, not ensemble methods.

# Research 23

Yes, Random Forest is an ensemble method used in the study.

# Research 24

Yes, two ensemble methods were used:
Ens1:  Combined ANN, NB, and VFI using majority voting.
Ens2: Combined NB and VFI using an AND logic for voting (predicting defective only if both agree).

# Research 25

The paper mentions prior studies using ensemble methods but this study doesn't employ them directly. The focus is on the impact of resampling techniques.

# Research 26

AdaBoost, Random Forest, Proposed: Naive Bayes Ensemble (NBE),  Naive Bayes Ensemble + TAN (NBE2)

# Research 27

No, ensemble methods were not used in this study.

# Research 28

No ensemble methods were used.

# Research 29

Not used.

# Research 30

No ensemble methods were used.
