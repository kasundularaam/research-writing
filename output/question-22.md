# QUESTION
Was there any analysis of computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques used?

# Research 1

The paper does not analyze the computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques.

# Research 2

While the paper highlights the computational advantages of LSSVM over SVM, it does not provide a detailed analysis of runtime performance or complexity for the proposed ensemble method.

# Research 3

Not discussed.

# Research 4

    - The paper does not provide explicit analysis of computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques.

# Research 5

The paper does not explicitly discuss the computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques used.

# Research 6

Not explicitly analyzed, but the use of early stopping and setting a fixed number of epochs (50) suggests efforts to manage training time.

# Research 7

No, computational complexity analysis is not provided.

# Research 8

Not analyzed in the excerpt.

# Research 9

No, there isn't an analysis of computational complexity or runtime.

# Research 10

No, the paper doesn't include analysis of computational complexity or runtime.

# Research 11

No, the paper doesn't discuss computational complexity or runtime performance.

# Research 12

Yes, Table 6 presents the training and testing time for the different methods on each dataset. SDNN had the second-longest average training time, but the authors consider the testing time acceptable.

# Research 13

The paper did not explicitly analyze the computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques. They did, however, mention the computational efficiency of Naive Bayes as an advantage.

# Research 14

Not discussed.

# Research 15

No, the paper doesn't discuss computational complexity or runtime.

# Research 16

The study does not include an analysis of computational complexity or runtime performance.

# Research 17

Not analyzed in this study.

# Research 18

Yes, the study reported the computational time taken by each technique and discussed the trade-off between performance and CPU time.

# Research 19

Yes, the runtime performance of MOFES and other methods is analyzed (see Table 13 in the paper). MOFES has higher computational cost than filter-based methods but lower than many wrapper-based methods.

# Research 20

No, there wasn't a detailed analysis of computational complexity or runtime performance.

# Research 21

No, the paper doesn't explicitly analyze computational complexity or runtime performance.

# Research 22

No, this aspect is not discussed in the provided excerpt.

# Research 23

No, the paper doesn't provide any analysis of computational complexity or runtime.

# Research 24
