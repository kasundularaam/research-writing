# QUESTION
Were any dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) used? If so, which ones?

# Research 1

The paper does not mention using any specific dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

# Research 2

No, the paper does not mention using PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques.

# Research 3

No mention of PCA or other techniques.

# Research 4

   - No dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA are explicitly mentioned in this excerpt.

# Research 5

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a feature ranking method.

# Research 6

Not explicitly mentioned, but the word embedding layer within the CNN model inherently performs dimensionality reduction by representing words in a lower-dimensional space.

# Research 7

Dimensionality reduction techniques were not used explicitly, but feature selection served as a form of dimensionality reduction.

# Research 8

Not explicitly mentioned.

# Research 9

No dimensionality reduction techniques are mentioned in the paper.

# Research 10

Yes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used.

# Research 11

No dimensionality reduction techniques are mentioned.

# Research 12

No, dimensionality reduction techniques are not mentioned.

# Research 13

The study primarily focused on feature selection using the Markov Blanket method, but did not employ dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

# Research 14

No

# Research 15

No, the paper doesn't mention using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

# Research 16

No dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA) were explicitly mentioned in the study.

# Research 17

Yes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

# Research 18

No, but they used Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS).

# Research 19

The paper focuses on feature selection and doesn't mention using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

# Research 20

No, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA weren't explicitly mentioned.

# Research 21

Yes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was experimented with, but Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) yielded better results.

# Research 22

This is **not explicitly mentioned** in the excerpt.

# Research 23

No dimensionality reduction techniques are explicitly mentioned. However, they highlight the high correlation between features in the v4-v5 dataset and suggest dimensionality reduction might be beneficial (though they don't apply any).

# Research 24

Yes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for ANN to reduce dimensionality and complexity.

# Research 25

No dimensionality reduction techniques were explicitly mentioned.

# Research 26

No dimensionality reduction techniques were explicitly mentioned.

# Research 27

No, PCA or similar techniques were not used.

# Research 28

No dimensionality reduction techniques were explicitly mentioned.

# Research 29

Not explicitly mentioned, likely not used.

# Research 30

No dimensionality reduction techniques were used.
