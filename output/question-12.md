# QUESTION
What was the ratio of defective to non-defective modules in each dataset used?

# Research 1

The ratio of defective to non-defective modules varied across the datasets (Table 8). The paper provides a detailed analysis of imbalance ratios in software defect prediction datasets, finding that most are not as severely imbalanced as in some other domains.

# Research 2

KC1: 319 faulty / 1252 non-faulty (approximately 1:4 ratio)
PC4: 178 faulty / 1169 non-faulty (approximately 1:6.5 ratio)

# Research 3

Not provided.

# Research 4

    - Provided in Table 4 for each dataset. Ranges from 9.83% (CM1) to 66.4% (Velocity-1.6 and Xalan-2.6).

# Research 5

The percentage of defective (faulty) classes varies for each dataset. See Table 4 for the specific percentages.

# Research 6

The exact ratio is not provided for each dataset, but the study mentions using random over-sampling to balance class distribution in the training set, achieving a 50:50 ratio of buggy and clean instances.

# Research 7

Defect ratio varied across datasets, ranging from 1.01 to 22.28 (defective to total samples).

# Research 8

Not explicitly provided for each dataset.

# Research 9

This information is not explicitly provided in the paper.

# Research 10

This is given in Table 1 as "%Faulty":

* JM1: 19.35%
* KC1: 15.46%
* PC1: 6.94%
* jEdit 4.2-4.3: 44.72%

# Research 11

This information is not directly stated, but based on the confusion matrix (Table IV), there were 9 faulty modules and 18 non-faulty modules in the testing folds. This suggests a ratio of approximately 1:2 (defective:non-defective).

# Research 12

This information is provided in Table 1 under the "Imbalanced rate" column. It represents the rounded-down ratio of non-defects to defects.

# Research 13

The ratio of defective modules is provided in Table 3:

**NASA:**
* JM1: 19.32%
* KC1: 15.42%
* MC1: 1.47%
* PC1: 7.18%
* PC2: 0.51%
* PC3: 10.59%
* PC4: 13.21%
* PC5: 3.26%

**Eclipse:**
* Ecl2.0a: 14.49%
* Ecl2.1a: 10.83%
* Ecl3.0a: 14.80%

# Research 14

Not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but Figure 3 suggests that a large percentage of packages have no observed defects.

# Research 15

This is provided in Table 2 in the paper as "% Of Des Buggy":
   * CM1: 9.83% 
   * JM1: 19.35%
   * KC1: 24.85%
   * KC2: 20.49%
   * PC1: 6.94%

# Research 16

- JM1: 19% defective
- PC1: 6.8% defective
- KC1: 15.4% defective
- KC2: 20% defective

# Research 17

mozilla4: Not precisely given, but implies a small percentage of defective modules.
kc1:  325 defective modules out of 2108 (roughly 15.4%)
ar1 & ar4: 9 defective modules out of 121 (roughly 7.4%)
pc1: 76 defective modules out of 1107 (roughly 6.9%)

# Research 18

Rave: 32.8% change-prone classes, 67.2% non-change-prone classes. Math: 23.54% change-prone classes, 76.46% non-change-prone classes.

# Research 19

This ratio varies across the different projects within the RELINK and PROMISE datasets. The exact ratios are not explicitly mentioned, but you can derive them from the number of defective and total modules in Tables 1 and 2 of the paper.

# Research 20

* **Training data:** Approximately 17.45% faulty modules.
* **Testing data:** Approximately 18.33% faulty modules.

# Research 21

* KC1: 15.45%
* KC2: 20.49%
* CM1: 9.83%
* PC1: 6.94%
* JM1: 19.35%

# Research 22

This is presented as "Faulty modules" in Tables 3 and 4. It shows the percentage of faulty modules in each dataset. For example, in NASA PC1, it's 7.19%.

# Research 23

* v4-v5: 62 defective / 108 non-defective (approximately 1:1.74)
* v2-v5: 62 defective / 262 non-defective (approximately 1:4.23)

# Research 24

This information is available in Table 2 of the paper, showing defect rates for each dataset.

# Research 25

The imbalance ratio (Pfp) ranged from 3.8% to 17.46%. This means defective modules were significantly fewer than non-defective modules in each dataset.

# Research 26

See Table 2 and Table 3 for the percentage of defective modules in each dataset.

# Research 27

This ratio varies for each dataset and is expressed as the "% defective instances" in Table 2 of the paper.

# Research 28

KC1: 59 defective classes out of 145 (approximately 40.69% defective)

# Research 29

Not explicitly mentioned.

# Research 30

Out of 145 classes, 59 were defective (faulty), and the rest were non-defective.
