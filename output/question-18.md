# QUESTION
Was the study focused on within-project or cross-project defect prediction?

# Research 1

The focus of the study is not explicitly stated, but based on the datasets and typical use of these datasets, it appears to be primarily on **within-project** defect prediction.

# Research 2

The paper does not explicitly state whether the study focuses on within-project or cross-project defect prediction. However, the use of NASA MDP datasets, which are typically project-specific, suggests a within-project focus.

# Research 3

It's not explicitly stated, but the study seems to be focused on within-project defect prediction as it uses a single project (Eclipse) for analysis.

# Research 4

    - The excerpt specifies that the study focuses on **within-project defect prediction (WPDP)**. 

# Research 5

The study focuses on within-project defect prediction, aiming to identify faulty classes within a specific software project.

# Research 6

The study focused on within-project defect prediction (WPDP).
SPSC dataset used for cross-version WPDP
PSC dataset used for within-version WPDP

# Research 7

The paper doesn't explicitly state whether it's within-project or cross-project, but it uses standard defect datasets, which are often used for within-project prediction.

# Research 8

Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP)

# Research 9

The paper doesn't explicitly state this, but it appears to be within-project defect prediction since they use datasets from single projects (KC1 and Eclipse 3.0) to build and evaluate the models.

# Research 10

The paper doesn't explicitly state this, but based on the use of single datasets for each experiment, it appears to be focused on **within-project** defect prediction.

# Research 11

The study seems to be focused on within-project defect prediction, as they use data from a single project (CM1).

# Research 12

The paper does not explicitly state this. The datasets are from different software projects, but how the training and testing were split (within-project or cross-project) is not clear.

# Research 13

The study focused on within-project defect prediction. All models were trained and tested on data from the same software project.

# Research 14

Cross-project (models are trained on one release of Eclipse and tested on another).

# Research 15

The paper doesn't explicitly state this, but based on the use of NASA datasets and the general framing, it appears to be focused on within-project defect prediction.

# Research 16

The study focuses on within-project defect prediction as it uses datasets with information related to specific projects.

# Research 17

The study primarily focused on within-project defect prediction, aiming to identify defects within the same software project.

# Research 18

The study focused on within-project change proneness prediction. They analyzed consecutive releases of the same software projects.

# Research 19

Within-project

# Research 20

The study seems to be focused on **within-project defect prediction**, as they used datasets from specific projects within the PROMISE repository.

# Research 21

The study seems to focus on within-project defect prediction, as it uses datasets related to specific NASA software projects.

# Research 22

The excerpt **primarily focuses on within-project prediction**. However, it does mention cross-project fault prediction research in the related work section (Section 2, point vi).

# Research 23

The study seems to be focused on **within-project** defect prediction, as they are using different versions of the same Android project (android) to build and evaluate their models.

# Research 24

The paper doesn't explicitly mention whether the focus is within-project or cross-project defect prediction. However, the use of 10 * 10-fold cross-validation and the mention of "local" and "external" datasets suggest a focus on building models generalizable to unseen data, which aligns more with cross-project prediction.

# Research 25

Within-project defect prediction. Models were trained on a previous version of a project and tested on a new version.

# Research 26

The study focused on module-level defect prediction, but it doesn't specify whether it's within-project or cross-project. The use of publicly available datasets suggests that the evaluation might be leaning towards cross-project prediction.

# Research 27

The paper does not explicitly state the focus but implies a within-project prediction scenario, as it analyzes metrics at the class level within individual projects (datasets).

# Research 28

The study focuses on within-project defect prediction as it utilizes a single dataset (KC1).

# Research 29

The paper doesn't explicitly specify. It implies a focus on within-project prediction by using different projects as separate datasets.

# Research 30

The study focuses on within-project defect prediction, utilizing data from a single NASA project (KC1).
