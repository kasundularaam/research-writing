      "The Naive Bayes classifier, while simple and often effective, assumes conditional independence between attributes, which is often not met in practice.",
      "General Bayesian Network classifiers can result in overly complex network structures, making them less comprehensible.",
      "The Markov blanket feature selection procedure, while reducing the number of features, did not always improve performance and sometimes resulted in worse performance.",

      "Investigate the inclusion of information other than static code features into fault prediction models, such as information on intermodule relations and requirement metrics.",
      "Explore how other techniques such as support vector machines or neural networks perform under different development contexts.",
      "Further research on feature selection techniques that can select a smaller set of highly predictive features without negatively impacting performance."
