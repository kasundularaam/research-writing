"question-1": "The article is from July 2022.",
"question-2": "The study used five NASA datasets from the PROMISE repository:\n  * JM1\n  * CM1\n  * KC1\n  * KC2\n  * PC1",
"question-3": "* CM1: 498 instances\n* JM1: 10,885 instances\n* KC1: 2,109 instances\n* KC2: 522 instances\n* PC1: 1,109 instances",
"question-4": "The study evaluated these machine learning algorithms:\n\n* Bayesian Net\n* Logistic Regression\n* Multilayer Perceptron \n* Ruler Zero-R (or Rule ZeroR)\n* J48 (a decision tree algorithm)\n* Lazy IBK (k-nearest neighbors)\n* Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n* Neural Networks (mentioned briefly, but not extensively evaluated)\n* Random Forest \n* Decision Stump",
"question-5": "The paper mainly focuses on comparing accuracy with and without feature selection.  It does not provide detailed results like precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC for each individual classifier. This is a limitation of the paper.\n\n* a. What was the overall prediction accuracy?\n    * Accuracies vary significantly between datasets and with/without feature selection. See Tables 4 and 5 in the paper for the specific accuracy values.  \n    * Logistic Regression generally performed well, achieving over 90% accuracy on most datasets with feature selection.\n* b. What was the precision? Not reported.\n* c. What was the recall? Not reported.\n* d. What was the F1-score? Not reported.\n* e. What was the AUC-ROC value (if reported)? Not reported.",
"question-6": "The paper doesn't explicitly list the software metrics used as features. This is another limitation. It mentions that the datasets are from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP), which typically include metrics like:\n\n* McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity\n* Lines of Code\n* Number of Functions/Methods\n* Number of Variables\n* Coupling Measures\n* Cohesion Measures",
"question-7": "* a. What was its individual predictive power (if reported)? Not reported.\n* b. Was it ranked or weighted in terms of importance? If so, what was its rank or weight? Not reported. The paper mentions feature selection, but it doesn't provide details about the ranking or weighting of individual metrics.",
"question-8": "The paper primarily uses accuracy as the performance measure.",
"question-9": "No, the paper doesn't mention using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.",
"question-10": "Yes, the paper includes these ensemble methods:\n\n* Random Forest",
"question-11": "Yes, the paper mentions using 10-fold cross-validation for experiments without feature selection.  For experiments with feature selection, it uses 30-fold cross-validation.",
"question-12": "This is provided in Table 2 in the paper as \"% Of Des Buggy\":\n   * CM1: 9.83% \n   * JM1: 19.35%\n   * KC1: 24.85%\n   * KC2: 20.49%\n   * PC1: 6.94%",
"question-13": "The paper mentions preprocessing, but it doesn't provide specifics. Common preprocessing steps in defect prediction include:\n\n* Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates.\n* Data transformation:  Normalization or standardization of data.",
"question-14": "Yes, feature selection was performed. However, the paper doesn't specify the exact feature selection method used.  Common methods include filter methods (e.g., correlation-based), wrapper methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination), and embedded methods (e.g., LASSO regularization).",
"question-15": "Yes, the literature review discusses several other studies and techniques for defect prediction, but the paper doesn't directly compare its results to specific results from those studies.",
"question-16": "The paper mentions using WEKA, a popular open-source machine learning tool in Java, for feature selection.",
"question-17": "The paper doesn't provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. It primarily focuses on comparing accuracy.",
"question-18": "The paper doesn't explicitly state this, but based on the use of NASA datasets and the general framing, it appears to be focused on within-project defect prediction.",
"question-19": "No, the study doesn't propose any new or hybrid techniques. It focuses on evaluating existing machine learning algorithms.",
"question-20": "The main conclusions are:\n\n* Logistic Regression performed well overall.\n* Feature selection significantly improves accuracy.\n* No single technique consistently outperformed others across all datasets.",
"question-21": "Yes, the paper highlights these challenges:\n\n* Choosing the right prediction model can be difficult.\n* The performance of models is highly dependent on the dataset.",
"question-22": "No, the paper doesn't discuss computational complexity or runtime.",
"question-23": "The paper suggests these areas for future research:\n\n* Exploring more datasets and classifiers.\n* Investigating the underlying structure of software to improve model selection.",
"question-24": "No, these concepts are not mentioned.",
"question-25": "Yes, the paper includes bar charts to show:\n\n* Accuracy of different algorithms with and without feature selection.\n* Number of instances in each dataset.\n* Percentage of buggy modules in each dataset.",
"question-26": "No, the paper doesn't address the interpretability of the models.",
"question-27": "No specific real-world applications are discussed.",
"question-28": "No, cost-effectiveness is not analyzed.",
"question-29": "No, the paper doesn't make this comparison.",
"question-30": "The paper briefly mentions that no single technique works for all datasets, suggesting limitations in generalizability. However, it doesn't provide an in-depth discussion on this aspect."
