"question-1": "2013",
"question-2": "* The study uses the open-source **Eclipse 3.4** system.",
"question-3": "The paper does not mention the number of instances (classes) extracted from the Eclipse dataset.",
"question-4": "* **Logistic Regression:** Used to analyze the relationship between bad smells and fault proneness.\n* **Bayesian Inference:**  Employed to combine prior knowledge (prior distributions on metrics) with observed data (likelihood from the Eclipse dataset) to build posterior distributions for fault prediction.",
"question-5": "The paper does not provide accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC values for either technique. It focuses on visualizing the posterior distributions of CBO and NOC to show their potential as predictors.",
"question-6": "* CBO (Coupling Between Object classes)\n* WMC (Weighted Methods per Class)\n* RFC (Response For a Class)\n* NOC (Number Of Children)\n* LCOM (Lack of Cohesion on Methods)\n* DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree)",
"question-7": "The paper primarily analyzes CBO and NOC using Bayesian inference and doesn't quantify the individual predictive power or ranking of metrics.\nIt mentions that LOC (Lines of Code) seemed to perform well for quick fault prediction in another study.",
"question-8": "The paper primarily uses visual analysis of the Bayesian posterior distributions.  Quantitative performance measures are not reported.",
"question-9": "No mention of PCA or other techniques.",
"question-10": "No ensemble methods were used.",
"question-11": "Not mentioned.",
"question-12": "Not provided.",
"question-13": "The paper mentions using Analyst4j to collect CK metrics and identify \"bad smells\" in the Eclipse code, which can be considered a form of data preprocessing.",
"question-14": "No formal feature selection method is described.",
"question-15": "The related work section discusses several studies using CK metrics and other techniques but does not directly compare their results to the current study's findings.",
"question-16": "* **Analyst4j:** Used for metric collection and bad smell detection.\n* **Matlab:**  Used for evaluation and likely for Bayesian inference implementation.",
"question-17": "The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques.",
"question-18": "It's not explicitly stated, but the study seems to be focused on within-project defect prediction as it uses a single project (Eclipse) for analysis.",
"question-19": "While not entirely novel, combining Bayesian inference with software metrics for fault proneness prediction was less common at the time of publication.",
"question-20": "The paper lacks a comparative evaluation of different machine learning techniques.",
"question-21": "The paper does not elaborate on specific challenges or limitations.",
"question-22": "Not discussed.",
"question-23": "No specific future work is outlined.",
"question-24": "Not considered.",
"question-25": "The paper presents Bayesian inference graphs (posterior distributions) for CBO and NOC.",
"question-26": "The authors highlight the intuitive nature of Bayesian inference but do not delve into model interpretability techniques.",
"question-27": "Not discussed beyond the use of the Eclipse dataset.",
"question-28": "Not analyzed.",
"question-29": "The study focuses on traditional CK metrics and doesn't compare them to more advanced metrics.",
"question-30": "The authors don't discuss the generalizability of their findings to other projects or domains."
