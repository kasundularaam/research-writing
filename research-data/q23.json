"question-5": "This information can be found in Tables 3 and 5. Unfortunately, the paper doesn't provide accuracy or F1-score, and AUC-ROC isn't mentioned.\n\n| Technique | Dataset | Precision (P) | Recall (R) |\n|---|---|---|---||\n| Random Forest (RF) | v4-v5 | 0.616 | 0.618 |\n|  | v2-v5 | 0.820 | 0.836 |\n| Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) | v4-v5 | 0.413 | 0.624 | \n|  | v2-v5 | 0.616 | 0.618 |\n| J48 | v4-v5 | 0.524 | 0.624 |\n|  | v2-v5 | 0.822 | 0.840 |\n| GFS-Adaboost-c (GFS-AB-c) | v4-v5 | 0.646 | 0.963 |\n|  | v2-v5 | 0.815 | 0.992 |\n| GFS-logitboost-c (GFS-LB-c) | v4-v5 | 0.646 | 0.963 |\n|  | v2-v5 | 0.822 | 0.992 |",

"question-7": "a. The paper **does not report** the individual predictive power of each metric.\nb. The paper **does not rank or weight** the metrics in terms of importance.",
"question-8": "* Precision\n* Recall",
"question-9": "No dimensionality reduction techniques are explicitly mentioned. However, they highlight the high correlation between features in the v4-v5 dataset and suggest dimensionality reduction might be beneficial (though they don't apply any).",
"question-10": "Yes, Random Forest is an ensemble method used in the study.",
"question-11": "Yes, 10-fold cross-validation was used.",
"question-12": "* v4-v5: 62 defective / 108 non-defective (approximately 1:1.74)\n* v2-v5: 62 defective / 262 non-defective (approximately 1:4.23)",
"question-13": "No specific data preprocessing techniques are mentioned besides the computation of change metrics from the raw data.",
"question-14": "No explicit feature selection method is mentioned. However, the hybrid algorithms (GFS-Adaboost-c and GFS-logitboost-c) inherently incorporate feature selection as part of their optimization process.",
"question-15": "Yes, in Section 2 (Related Work), they compare their approach to several other studies that used different metrics and techniques, including:\n\n* Choudhary et al. (2018)\n* Malhotra (2016)\n* Moser and Pedrycz (2008)\n* Yang et al. (2015)\n* Sharma and Chandra (2018)\n* Kaur and Kaur (2018)\n* Kaur and Kaur (2014)\n* Manjula and Florence (2018)\n* Erturk and Sezer (2015)",
"question-16": "* **Weka:**  (Java-based) used for implementing the Machine Learning Techniques (MLT).\n* **Keel:** Used for implementing the Hybrid Search Based Algorithms (HSBA).",
"question-17": "The paper doesn't explicitly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of individual MLTs. However, they observe that hybrid algorithms achieve higher recall than MLTs in both datasets. They also point to the correlation between features in the v4-v5 dataset as a potential reason for the lower performance of all techniques on that dataset.",
"question-18": "The study seems to be focused on **within-project** defect prediction, as they are using different versions of the same Android project (android) to build and evaluate their models.",
"question-19": "The study primarily focuses on evaluating existing hybrid techniques (GFS-Adaboost-c and GFS-logitboost-c) in the context of change metrics for defect prediction. They don't propose any novel hybrid techniques.",
"question-20": "The key conclusion is that hybrid search-based algorithms (specifically GFS-logitboost-c) outperform traditional machine learning techniques in terms of recall when using change metrics for defect prediction in the Android project studied.",
"question-21": "They mention the threat to generalizability due to focusing on a single Java-based project (Android). They also highlight the potential influence of software size on defect prediction and the need to investigate this further.",
"question-22": "No, the paper doesn't provide any analysis of computational complexity or runtime.",
"question-23": "Yes, they recommend:\n\n*  Experimenting on diverse datasets and larger datasets to enhance the generalizability of the findings.\n* Investigating the impact of software size on the effectiveness of change metrics for defect prediction.",
"question-24": "No, transfer learning or domain adaptation are not mentioned in the study.",
"question-25": "Yes, they provide a bar chart (Figure 2) to compare the precision and recall of different MLT and HSBA techniques on the two datasets.",
"question-26": "No, the paper doesn't discuss the interpretability of the models.",
"question-27": "While they use the open-source Android project, they don't explicitly discuss specific industrial or real-world applications.",
"question-28": "No cost-effectiveness analysis is provided.",
"question-29": "No, the study focuses solely on change metrics (SCM) and doesn't compare them to other types of metrics.",
"question-30": "Yes, they acknowledge the limitation of using a single Java-based project and recommend further studies with more diverse datasets to assess generalizability."
