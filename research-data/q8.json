"question-1": "2017",
"question-2": "34 datasets from 10 open-source projects: Ant, Camel, Ivy, Jedit, Lucene, Poi, Synapse, Xalan, Xerces.",
"question-3": "Not provided in the excerpt.",
"question-4": "Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Tree (RT), Diffused Bayes (DB) - Proposed novel technique",
"question-5": "See table in response.",
"question-6": "20 static code metrics were used, top 5 used in general feature subset: CE, LCOM, LOC, RFC, CBO",
"question-7": "Not individually reported in the excerpt.",
"question-8": "Recall, Precision, F-measure",
"question-9": "Not explicitly mentioned.",
"question-10": "Not used.",
"question-11": "Not explicitly mentioned. Experiments were repeated 50 times with different data subsets for robustness.",
"question-12": "Not explicitly provided for each dataset.",
"question-13": "Transformation of the \"bug\" variable into a binary classification (buggy/non-buggy).",
"question-14": "Yes, a general feature subset was created using the top 5 most occurring software metrics.",
"question-15": "Performance of the proposed DB classifier is compared against NB, SVM, LR, and RT. Discussion on Recall and false alarm rate stability compared to Precision, referencing Menzies et al. [17].",
"question-16": "Not explicitly mentioned.",
"question-17": "DB: Handles non-normal data distribution well, particularly effective with smaller training datasets.\nLR: Showed higher precision in some experiments but might be less stable than Recall-focused techniques.",
"question-18": "Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP)",
"question-19": "Diffused Bayes (DB) Classifier: Proposed as an improvement over traditional NB by incorporating the Vibration of String Based Diffusion Function (VSDF) to address non-normal data distributions and small sample sizes.",
"question-20": "DB demonstrated superior and more stable performance in terms of Recall and F-measure, especially with limited training data. NB and LR showed comparable results in Precision, but their performance varied across experiments.",
"question-21": "Not explicitly discussed in the provided section.",
"question-22": "Not analyzed in the excerpt.",
"question-23": "Improve the generality of the VSDF. Simplify metric attribute sets for enhanced predictive performance.",

"question-27": "Not discussed in this section.",
"question-28": "Not analyzed.",
"question-29": "No comparison provided.",
"question-30": "The study focuses on cross-project prediction, aiming for generalizability. While the results show promise for DB, further research is suggested to improve the generalizability of VSDF and refine feature sets."
