"question-1": "The publication year is 2010, as indicated by the copyright notice at the bottom of the first page.",
"question-2": "The study primarily focuses on the CM1 dataset from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP) repository. While they mention JM1 and PC1, these datasets are not used in their analysis.",
"question-3": "The CM1 dataset used has 266 instances (modules) after data preprocessing.",
"question-4": "* K-means clustering: Used as a preprocessing technique.\n* Decision Tree (C4.5 algorithm): Used for fault prediction.",
"question-5": "a. Not explicitly stated.\nb. 100% for both classes (faulty and non-faulty).\nc. 100% for both classes (faulty and non-faulty). \nd. Not explicitly calculated, but it would be 1.0 given the precision and recall values.\ne. Not explicitly calculated, but implied to be 1.0 based on the ROC curve reaching the top-left corner (0,1).",
"question-6": "The study used a fusion of requirement metrics and code metrics. Refer to Table II in the paper for the complete list of 31 metrics. This includes:\n    * Requirement metrics (e.g., ACTION, CONDITIONAL, RISK_LEVEL)\n    * Code metrics (e.g., Halstead metrics, Cyclomatic Complexity, LOC_BLANK)",
"question-7": "a. Not reported individually.\nb. No explicit ranking or weighting is provided. However, the resulting decision tree (Figure 4) indicates that RISK_LEVEL was the most important feature in this specific dataset.",
"question-8": "* Confusion Matrix: To calculate True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives.\n* Probability of Detection (PD) / Recall:  (TP / (TP + FN))\n* Probability of False Alarms (PF): (FP / (FP + TN))\n* ROC Curve: Visual representation of PD vs. PF.",
"question-9": "No dimensionality reduction techniques are mentioned.",
"question-10": "No ensemble methods were used.",
"question-11": "Yes, 10-fold cross-validation was used.",
"question-12": "This information is not directly stated, but based on the confusion matrix (Table IV), there were 9 faulty modules and 18 non-faulty modules in the testing folds. This suggests a ratio of approximately 1:2 (defective:non-defective).",
"question-13": "Yes, K-means clustering was used as a preprocessing step before applying the decision tree algorithm.",
"question-14": "No explicit feature selection method is described. The decision tree algorithm itself inherently performs feature selection by choosing the most discriminative features at each node.",
"question-15": "They briefly mention other techniques (statistical methods, machine learning, neural networks) in the introduction but do not provide a direct comparison with their approach.  They do, however, cite studies that use requirement metrics, code metrics, or combinations of both.",
"question-16": "The paper mentions using RapidMiner, a data mining and machine learning software.",
"question-17": "* Strengths:  K-means helps in handling limited fault data; Decision trees are relatively easy to interpret.\n* Weaknesses: Not explicitly discussed, but potential limitations of decision trees include overfitting and sensitivity to noisy data.",
"question-18": "The study seems to be focused on within-project defect prediction, as they use data from a single project (CM1).",
"question-19": "Yes, the study proposes a hybrid approach by combining K-means clustering for preprocessing with a Decision Tree (C4.5) for fault prediction. This combination is presented as a way to improve prediction with limited fault data.",
"question-20": "The main conclusion is that their proposed hybrid model (K-means + Decision Tree) can effectively predict fault-prone modules early in the software life cycle, particularly when using a combination of requirement and code metrics.",
"question-21": "The paper highlights the limited availability of fault proneness data as a challenge, which motivates their use of semi-supervised clustering.",
"question-22": "No, the paper doesn't discuss computational complexity or runtime performance.",
"question-23": "No specific recommendations for future research are explicitly stated.",
"question-24": "No, transfer learning or domain adaptation is not discussed.",
"question-25": "Yes, the paper provides:\n   * An E-R Diagram (Figure 1) showing the relationships between requirements, modules, and faults.\n   * Snapshots of the data view and meta-data view in RapidMiner (Figures 2 and 3)\n   * A visualization of the generated decision tree (Figure 4).\n   * An ROC Curve (Figure 5)",
"question-26": "While not extensively discussed, they imply the interpretability of decision trees as a benefit, as the resulting tree (Figure 4) directly shows the most important feature (RISK_LEVEL).",
"question-27": "The study uses NASA datasets (CM1), which represent real-world software projects, implying practical applications.",
"question-28": "No, there's no explicit analysis of cost-effectiveness.",
"question-29": "No, such comparisons are not made in this study.",
"question-30": "The paper doesn't explicitly address generalizability. However, using NASA datasets with different project types (spacecraft instrument, ground system, satellite system) suggests some level of potential generalizability."
