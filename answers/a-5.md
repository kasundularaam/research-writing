   * The paper does not report individual predictive power for each metric.
   * Metrics are ranked and selected using feature selection techniques. See questions 9 and 14 for details.

**8. Performance Measures Used:**
   * Accuracy
   * F-Measure
   * Normalized Estimated Fault Removal Cost (NEcost)

**9. Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a feature ranking method.

**10. Ensemble Methods:** No ensemble methods were used in this study.

**11. Cross-Validation:** 20-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate and compare the models.

**12. Defective to Non-defective Ratio:** The percentage of defective (faulty) classes varies for each dataset. See Table 4 for the specific percentages.

**13. Data Preprocessing:** 
   * Data is normalized using Min-Max normalization to the range [0,1].

**14. Feature Selection:** Ten different feature selection techniques are used:
    * **Feature Ranking:**
        * Chi Squared test
        * Gain Ratio Feature Evaluation
        * Information Gain Feature Evaluation
        * OneR Feature Evaluation
        * Logistic Regression Analysis

        * Rough Set Analysis (RSA)

**15. Comparative Analyses:**
   * The study compares the performance of LSSVM with different kernels.
   * It also compares the performance of LSSVM against other commonly used classification techniques (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, SVM with various kernels).

**16. Programming Language/Tool:** The machine learning models were implemented using MATLAB.

**17. Strengths and Weaknesses of Techniques:**
    * The paper primarily focuses on comparing the overall performance of different techniques and does not explicitly discuss individual strengths and weaknesses.
    * However, it highlights that LSSVM with the RBF kernel performs well in general.

**18. Focus of Study:** The study focuses on within-project defect prediction, aiming to identify faulty classes within a specific software project.

**19. Novel or Hybrid Techniques:** No novel or hybrid techniques were explicitly proposed in this study. The focus is on evaluating existing techniques using a cost-based evaluation framework.

**20. Effectiveness of Techniques:** 
   * LSSVM with the RBF kernel, coupled with feature selection using Rough Set Analysis or PCA, was found to be effective.
   * Feature selection techniques were generally found to improve prediction accuracy compared to using all metrics.

**21. Challenges and Limitations:** 
   * The paper highlights that psychological factors and team-related aspects are not considered, which can impact real-world software reliability.
   * It also mentions the limitation of only predicting whether a class is faulty or not, without providing information on the possible number of bugs within the class.

**22. Computational Complexity Analysis:** The paper does not explicitly discuss the computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques used.

**23. Recommendations for Future Research:**
   * Extending the work to predict the number of bugs within a faulty class.
   * Replicating the study on other programming paradigms and languages.
   * Incorporating psychological factors and team-related aspects into the models.

**24. Transfer Learning/Domain Adaptation:** This aspect was not considered in the study.

**25. Visualizations:**
   * Box-plot diagrams are used to visualize the distribution of Accuracy and F-Measure for different feature selection techniques (Fig. 8a-c).
   * Similar box-plot diagrams are used for comparing the performance of LSSVM with other classifiers (Fig. 11).
   * Figures are used to depict the NEcost of fault prediction techniques for varying fault identification efficiencies (Figs. 13-15).
   * Heatmaps are used to visualize the results of t-test analysis (Figs. 9 and 12).

**26. Interpretability of Models:** The paper does not specifically discuss the interpretability of the models used.

**27. Industrial/Real-world Applications:** While the study uses open-source datasets, it discusses the practical implications of the findings for real-world software development, particularly regarding the use of feature selection to reduce complexity and improve model efficiency.

**28. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis:** The paper proposes and uses a cost-based evaluation framework to assess the cost-effectiveness of the fault prediction approach, considering fault removal costs at different testing phases.

**29. Comparisons with Advanced Metrics:** The study focuses on traditional object-oriented software metrics and does not compare them with more advanced or domain-specific metrics.

**30. Generalizability of Results:** The authors acknowledge that the study's external validity might be limited due to using only Java projects. They suggest further research to replicate the findings on other programming languages and paradigms. However, they believe that the general principles and insights gained from the study can be applied to other object-oriented software development projects.
