## Answers based on the provided research paper:

**1. Publication year:** 2019

**2. Datasets:**
* Simplified PROMISE Source Code (SPSC)
* PROMISE Source Code (PSC)

**3. Dataset sizes:**
* SPSC: 6538 instances
* PSC: 14,066 instances

**4. Machine learning techniques:**
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - proposed improved model
* Deep Belief Network (DBN) - used as baseline
* CNN -  Li's CNN model used as a baseline
* Traditional machine learning models - used as baselines for the PSC dataset:
    * Decision Tree (DT)

    * Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
    * Random Forest (RF)
    * RBF Network (NET)
* RANDOM model - predicts buggy at a probability of 0.5
* FIX model - predicts all files as buggy

**5. Performance metrics for each technique:**

Due to the large number of versions and multiple metrics used, we'll summarize the overall findings instead of listing individual project/version results.

* **Improved CNN:** Outperformed traditional baselines and was comparable to DBN and Li's CNN on SPSC dataset. Achieved best average performance on PSC dataset across all metrics.
* **DBN, Li's CNN:** Comparable performance to the proposed CNN model, outperforming traditional methods.
* **Traditional models (DT, LR, NB, RF, NET):**  Outperformed by deep learning models on average, with RF being the closest competitor in MCC.
* **RANDOM, FIX:**  Performed poorly, indicating the effectiveness of other models.

Specific precision, recall, and AUC-ROC values are not explicitly reported in the tables.

**6. Software metrics used:**

The study **did not use traditional hand-crafted software metrics**. Instead, it extracted features from **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)** of source code.

**7. Individual predictive power of metrics:**

Not applicable as traditional software metrics weren't used. The focus was on automatically learning features from ASTs using deep learning.

**8. Performance measures:**
* F-measure (F1-score)
* G-measure
* Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

**9. Dimensionality reduction techniques:**

Not explicitly mentioned, but the word embedding layer within the CNN model inherently performs dimensionality reduction by representing words in a lower-dimensional space.

**10. Ensemble methods:**

Not used in this study, but suggested as a future research direction to address hyperparameter instability.

**11. Cross-validation:**

* **SPSC dataset:** 30-holdout repeated experiments
* **PSC dataset:** 10 x 10 cross-validation

**12. Defective to non-defective module ratio:**

The exact ratio is not provided for each dataset, but the study mentions using random over-sampling to balance class distribution in the training set, achieving a 50:50 ratio of buggy and clean instances.

**13. Data preprocessing techniques:**
* Parsing source code into ASTs using javalang
* Mapping string tokens to integers
* Handling class imbalance using random over-sampling
* Deleting infrequent tokens

**14. Feature selection:**

Performed implicitly by selecting 29 specific AST node types based on prior research and practical considerations.

**15. Comparative analysis:**

The study compared the proposed CNN model with:
* Li's CNN model
* DBN model
* Traditional machine learning models (on PSC dataset)
* RANDOM model
* FIX model

**16. Programming language/tool:**
* Python
* Keras (high-level API built on TensorFlow)

**17. Strengths/weaknesses of each technique:**

* **Improved CNN:** Strengths - Learns semantic representations from ASTs, good generalization. Weakness -  Sensitivity to hyperparameter instability.
* **DBN, Li's CNN:** Strengths - Ability to learn complex features from ASTs. Weaknesses - Performance variability, limited investigation of hyperparameter settings.
* **Traditional models:** Strengths - Simpler and faster to train. Weaknesses - Reliance on hand-crafted features, lower accuracy than deep learning models.

**18. Within-project vs. cross-project:**

The study focused on **within-project defect prediction (WPDP)**.

* SPSC dataset used for **cross-version WPDP**
* PSC dataset used for **within-version WPDP**

**19. Novel/hybrid techniques:**

The study proposes an **improved CNN model** which incorporates elements from existing deep learning models, aiming for better generalization and feature extraction.

**20. Conclusions on effectiveness:**

Deep learning models (CNN, DBN) consistently outperformed traditional machine learning models for WPDP. The proposed improved CNN model demonstrated the best overall performance on the PSC dataset.

**21. Challenges/limitations:**

* Hyperparameter instability in deep learning models, leading to performance fluctuations.
* Limited generalizability of the findings to other datasets or programming languages.
* Reliance on existing research for baseline model implementation, potentially introducing bias.

**22. Computational complexity/runtime:**

Not explicitly analyzed, but the use of early stopping and setting a fixed number of epochs (50) suggests efforts to manage training time.

**23. Recommendations for future research:**

* Collecting more diverse datasets (C/C++, other domains).
* Exploring different deep learning architectures (RNN).
* Investigating the types of defects predictable by deep learning.
* Developing deep ensemble models to address hyperparameter instability.

**24. Transfer learning/domain adaptation:**

Not considered in this study.

**25. Visualizations:**

Yes, the study provides:
* Workflow diagram of the software defect prediction process
* CNN architecture diagram
* Skip-gram model illustration
* Dropout illustration
* Proposed improved CNN model illustration
* Graphs showing the impact of dense layers/nodes and kernel size/stride on F-measure.

**26. Model interpretability:**

Not explicitly discussed, but the focus on automatically learning features from ASTs inherently makes interpretation more challenging compared to models using hand-crafted features.

**27. Industrial/real-world applications:**

Not discussed, the focus is on academic research.

**28. Cost-effectiveness:**

Not analyzed in the study.

**29. Traditional vs. advanced metrics:**

The study directly uses ASTs as input, bypassing the need for traditional software metrics.

**30. Generalizability:**

The study acknowledges limitations in generalizing the results to other datasets or programming languages. Further research is needed to assess broader applicability.
