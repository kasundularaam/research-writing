   **Note:** The F1-score is not explicitly reported in the paper.

**6. Software metrics used as features:**
   * Coupling Between Objects (CBO)
   * Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)
   * Response for a Class (RFC)
   * Source Lines of Code (SLOC)
   * Lack of Cohesion (LCOM)
   * Number of Children (NOC)
   * Depth of Inheritance (DIT)

**7. Individual predictive power and ranking/weighting:**

   * The paper analyzes the individual predictive power through univariate logistic regression and presents R² values for each metric across different severity levels (See Tables 5, 6, 7, 8).
   * While not explicitly ranked, the study identifies SLOC and CBO as the strongest predictors based on their consistently high R² values. 
   * The study doesn't explicitly assign weights to the metrics.

**8. Performance measures:**
   * Sensitivity
   * Specificity
   * Precision
   * Completeness
   * Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)

**9. Dimensionality reduction techniques:** No dimensionality reduction techniques were used.

**10. Ensemble methods:** No ensemble methods were used.

**11. Cross-validation:** Yes, 10-fold cross-validation was used.

**12. Defective to non-defective module ratio:** Out of 145 classes, 59 were defective (faulty), and the rest were non-defective.

**13. Data preprocessing:** 
    * Removed faults classified as "not a fault".
    * Min-max normalization was applied to normalize input metric values to the range [0, 1].

**14. Feature selection:** Forward stepwise selection was used for logistic regression. All features selected in univariate analysis were included for the backward elimination method in ANN.

**15. Comparative analysis:** Yes, the study compared its findings to numerous previous studies on object-oriented metrics and fault proneness prediction. These comparisons are summarized in Table 24 and discussed throughout the paper.

**16. Programming language/tool:** The paper does not specify the programming language or tool used for implementing the machine learning models.

**17. Strengths and weaknesses of each ML technique:**

   * **DT:** Showed the best overall performance in terms of AUC-ROC and completeness across different severity levels.
   * **ANN:** Performed slightly worse than DT but still better than LR.  
   * **LR:** Simplest method, but its performance was lower than both DT and ANN.

**18. Within-project vs. cross-project:** The study focuses on within-project defect prediction, utilizing data from a single NASA project (KC1).

**19. Novel/hybrid techniques:** No novel or hybrid techniques were proposed. The study focused on evaluating the performance of established machine learning methods.

**20. Effectiveness of different ML techniques:** The study concludes that DT and ANN models outperform LR models for fault proneness prediction across all severity levels. 

**21. Challenges/limitations of using ML for bug prediction:**
    * The study acknowledges the general limitations of empirical studies, including potential generalizability issues due to using data from a single project. 
    * Subjectivity and potential inaccuracies in fault severity ratings within the KC1 dataset are also mentioned as limitations.

**22. Computational complexity/runtime performance:**  The paper does not discuss the computational complexity or runtime performance of the different techniques.

**23. Recommendations for future research:**
    * Replicate the study with different datasets to generalize the findings.
    * Explore the application of other machine learning algorithms, such as genetic algorithms.
    * Conduct cost-benefit analyses of different fault proneness prediction models.

**24. Transfer learning/domain adaptation:** Transfer learning or domain adaptation was not considered in this study.

**25. Visualizations:** Yes, ROC curves were used to visualize and compare the performance of different models (Figures 2, 3, 4).

**26. Interpretability of ML models:** The paper doesn't focus on interpreting the models. The analysis primarily relies on performance metrics for comparison.

**27. Industrial/real-world applications:** The paper mentions the potential applicability of the models for software practitioners in planning and prioritizing testing efforts. However, it doesn't discuss specific real-world case studies.

**28. Cost-effectiveness:** The cost-effectiveness of the bug prediction approach is mentioned as a potential future research direction but is not explicitly analyzed in the study.

**29. Comparisons between traditional and advanced metrics:** No comparisons were made between traditional and advanced software metrics. 

**30. Generalizability of results:** The paper acknowledges the limited generalizability of the results due to using data from a single project and recommends replicating the study with different datasets to draw stronger conclusions.
