2018 (From the conference proceedings title)


**2. Which dataset(s) were used in the study? (List all)**

**3. What is the size of each dataset used (number of instances)?**

* JM1: 10885 instances
* KC1: 2109 instances
* PC1: 1109 instances
* jEdit 4.2-4.3: 369 instances


**4. What machine learning technique(s) were employed in the study? (List all)**

* Decision Tree (DT)
* Random Forest (RF) 
* Naïve Bayes (NB)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* Adaboost


**5. For each machine learning technique used:** (See Table 2 in the paper for the exact values)

This information is best extracted directly from Table 2 in the paper, as the values vary across datasets and with/without feature selection. Here's a general summary:

* **Random Forest** generally had the highest accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC values across most datasets and feature selection scenarios. 
* **ANN** often performed well, sometimes second to Random Forest.
* **SVM** had highly variable performance, struggling particularly when dimensionality reduction was applied.
* **Naïve Bayes** consistently had the lowest accuracy.
* The paper doesn't explicitly list AUC-ROC for all individual classifier/dataset combinations.


**6. What software metrics were used as features for prediction? (List all)**

The paper mentions these types of metrics were used:

* Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) metrics
* McCabe metrics
* HalStead metrics 
* It also mentions LOC (Lines of Code) and Miscellaneous metrics for jEdit

The exact metrics within these categories aren't explicitly listed in the paper.


**7. For each software metric used:**

*  The paper doesn't report the individual predictive power or ranking/weighting of each specific metric. This level of detail is often omitted in such studies.


**8. What performance measures were used to evaluate the model(s)? (List all)**

* Accuracy
* F-measure (F1-score)
* Precision
* Recall
* Area Under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve (AUC) 


**9. Were any dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) used? If so, which ones?**

Yes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used.


**10. Were any ensemble methods used? If so, which ones?**

Yes, 
* Random Forest (an ensemble of decision trees)
* Adaboost (another ensemble method)


**11. Was cross-validation used? If so, what type and how many folds?**

Yes, 10-fold cross-validation was used.


**12. What was the ratio of defective to non-defective modules in each dataset used?**

This is given in Table 1 as "%Faulty":

* JM1: 19.35%
* KC1: 15.46%
* PC1: 6.94%
* jEdit 4.2-4.3: 44.72%


**13. Were any data preprocessing techniques applied? If so, which ones?**

The paper doesn't explicitly mention specific data preprocessing steps beyond feature selection.


**14. Was feature selection performed? If so, what method was used?**

Yes, two feature selection methods were used with different search strategies:

* **Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection (CFS)** with **GreedyStepwise** search
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** with **Ranker** search method


**15. Were any comparative analyses performed with other studies or techniques? If so, with which ones?**

Yes, the "Related Works" section (Section II) discusses several other studies on software fault prediction using various techniques, providing context for their work.


**16. What programming language or tool was used to implement the machine learning models?**

The models were implemented using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) software, which is written in Java.


**17. Were there any specific strengths or weaknesses identified for each machine learning technique used?**

* **Strength of Random Forest:**  High accuracy and good performance across datasets, particularly with CFS feature selection.
* **Weakness of SVM:**  Sensitivity to dimensionality reduction, leading to performance drops with PCA.
* **Weakness of Naïve Bayes:** Consistently low accuracy compared to other techniques.


**18. Was the study focused on within-project or cross-project defect prediction?**

The paper doesn't explicitly state this, but based on the use of single datasets for each experiment, it appears to be focused on **within-project** defect prediction.


**19. Were any novel or hybrid techniques proposed? If so, describe them briefly.**

No, the study primarily focuses on evaluating the performance of existing, well-known machine learning techniques.


**20. What conclusions were drawn about the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques?**

* Random Forest was the most effective in most cases.
* Feature selection using CFS was generally beneficial.
* PCA was not as effective for feature selection in this context.
* The study supports the use of machine learning for software fault prediction.


**21. Were any specific challenges or limitations mentioned regarding the use of machine learning for bug prediction?**

No specific challenges or limitations were explicitly mentioned in the conclusion.


**22. Was there any analysis of computational complexity or runtime performance of the techniques used?**

No, the paper doesn't include analysis of computational complexity or runtime.


**23. Were any specific recommendations made for future research in this area?**

Yes, they recommend further studies with larger-scale software projects to validate the generalizability of the results.


**24. Was transfer learning or domain adaptation considered in the study?**

No, transfer learning or domain adaptation was not mentioned.


**25. Were any visualizations or graphical representations of the results provided? If so, what types?**

Yes, ROC curves were provided for each classifier and dataset, with and without feature selection. Bar charts comparing AUC values were also included.


**26. Was there any discussion on the interpretability of the machine learning models used?**

No, the paper doesn't discuss the interpretability of the models.


**27. Were any industrial or real-world applications of the techniques discussed?**

The datasets used are from real-world projects (NASA, etc.), but the paper doesn't discuss specific industrial applications beyond the research context.


**28. Was there any analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the bug prediction approach?**

No, cost-effectiveness was not analyzed.


**29. Were any comparisons made between traditional software metrics and more advanced or domain-specific metrics?**

No explicit comparison was made, though the study uses commonly employed traditional metrics.


**30. Was there any discussion on the generalizability of the results to other software projects or domains?**

They mention the need for further studies with larger projects to assess generalizability, implicitly acknowledging that the current results may have limitations in their generalizability.
