**10. Ensemble methods:** No

**11. Cross-validation:** Yes, across different releases of Eclipse (training on one release and testing on another).

**12. Ratio of defective to non-defective modules:** Not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but Figure 3 suggests that a large percentage of packages have no observed defects.

**13. Data preprocessing techniques:** No specific mention, but aggregation of class and method level metrics to file and package levels is performed.
