The paper is quite dense, and extracting all this information requires careful reading and interpretation. Here's my attempt to answer your questions based on the provided research paper:

**1. Publication year:** 2019

**2. Datasets used:**
   - RELINK
   - PROMISE

**3. Dataset sizes:**
   - **PROMISE:** Ranges from 229 modules (Velocity-1.6) to 965 modules (Camel-1.6). See Table 1 in the paper.
   - **RELINK:**  Ranges from 56 modules (Safe) to 399 modules (ZXing). See Table 2 in the paper.

**4. Machine learning techniques:**
   - J48 (Decision Tree)
   - K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
   - Logistic Regression (LR)
   - Naive Bayes (NB)

**5. Performance metrics for each technique:**
   - The paper primarily focuses on AUC-ROC as the main performance measure. 
   - It also uses F1 score for comparison between their proposed method (MOFES) and using all features (FULL).
   - Precision, Recall are mentioned as problematic and not used.
   - Specific accuracy values are not directly reported for each classifier individually.
   - Instead, the paper focuses on comparing their multi-objective feature selection approach against various baseline feature selection methods in terms of AUC-ROC and the number of selected features.

**6. Software metrics used as features:**
   - **RELINK:** 26 metrics based on code complexity, categorized as Complexity Metrics (CPM) and Count Metrics (CTM). See Table 3 in the paper.
   - **PROMISE:** 20 metrics, including object-oriented metrics (OOM) and complexity metrics (CPM). OOM is further divided into 5 metric suites (CK, HS, HD, ECK, Martin). See Table 3 in the paper.

**7. Individual predictive power and ranking:**
   - The paper doesn't explicitly report individual predictive power for each metric.
   - The analysis focuses on the frequency of feature selection by MOFES, grouping metrics by categories. See Tables 11 and 12 in the paper.
   - It infers that features in different categories might have varying performance impacts.

**8. Performance measures:**
   - Primarily **AUC-ROC** for model performance.
   - **Hypervolume (HV)** quality indicator for evaluating the quality of Pareto fronts generated by different multi-objective optimization algorithms.
   - **F1 score** is used when comparing MOFES to using all features (FULL).

**9. Dimensionality reduction techniques:** The paper focuses on feature selection and doesn't mention using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

**10. Ensemble methods:** No, the paper doesn't explicitly employ ensemble methods in its proposed approach.

**11. Cross-validation:**
   - Yes, **3-fold cross-validation** is used during the training process of MOFES.
   - **10-fold cross-validation** is used to evaluate the performance of MOFES and baseline methods. 

**12. Defective to non-defective ratio:** This ratio varies across the different projects within the RELINK and PROMISE datasets. The exact ratios are not explicitly mentioned, but you can derive them from the number of defective and total modules in Tables 1 and 2 of the paper.

**13. Data preprocessing techniques:**
   - **Feature selection** is the core preprocessing technique studied in the paper.
   - **Stratified sampling** is used to split the data into training and testing sets.

**14. Feature selection method:**
   - **MOFES (Multi-Objective FEature Selection):** The paper's novel approach, which treats feature selection as a multi-objective optimization problem.
   - It uses Pareto based multi-objective optimization algorithms (PMAs), specifically NSGA-II, based on their analysis in RQ1.
   - The paper compares MOFES with 22 state-of-the-art filter and wrapper based feature selection methods. 

**15. Comparative analyses:**
   - Extensive comparisons are performed with 22 existing filter and wrapper based feature selection methods across the chosen datasets and classifiers.
   - The comparison focuses on AUC-ROC, the number of features selected, and computational cost.

**16. Programming language/tool:**
   - Java
   - Weka packages for machine learning implementations.
   - JMetal packages for multi-objective optimization algorithms. 

**17. Strengths/weaknesses of techniques:**
   - The paper doesn't deeply analyze individual strengths and weaknesses of each classifier (J48, KNN, LR, NB).
   - It focuses on the effectiveness of their feature selection method (MOFES) in improving performance and reducing the number of features compared to other feature selection methods.

**18. Within-project or cross-project:** The study focuses on **within-project** defect prediction.

**19. Novel/hybrid techniques:**
   - **MOFES** is the main novel technique proposed, using a multi-objective optimization approach for feature selection in defect prediction.

**20. Conclusions on effectiveness:**
   - MOFES shows promising results, achieving better performance (AUC-ROC) while using fewer features compared to many baseline methods.
   - This suggests that multi-objective feature selection is beneficial in this context.

**21. Challenges/limitations:**
   - The paper acknowledges that MOFES has a higher computational cost than filter-based feature selection methods, though lower than most wrapper based methods.
   - The choice of hyperparameters for the classifiers is not extensively explored.
   - The impact of MOFES on model interpretability is not investigated in this study.

**22. Computational complexity/runtime:**
   - Yes, the runtime performance of MOFES and other methods is analyzed (see Table 13 in the paper). 
   - MOFES has higher computational cost than filter-based methods but lower than many wrapper-based methods.

**23. Recommendations for future research:**
   - Explore the generalizability of findings to other projects and datasets.
   - Optimize MOFES and incorporate more advanced PMAs.
   - Consider combining MOFES with class imbalance learning techniques.
   - Investigate the impact of MOFES on model interpretability. 

**24. Transfer learning/domain adaptation:** Not considered in this study.

**25. Visualizations:**
   - Yes, boxplots are used to visualize the performance distributions of different PMAs in terms of HV (see Figures 5-8).
   - Line plots are used to compare MOFES and other methods in terms of AUC-ROC and the number of selected features (see Figures 9 and 10).

**26. Model interpretability:** Not discussed in this particular study.

**27. Industrial/real-world applications:**  The paper focuses on open source projects and doesn't discuss specific industrial applications.

**28. Cost-effectiveness:** Not explicitly analyzed, though the reduction in the number of features suggests potential benefits in terms of data collection and model construction costs.

**29. Traditional vs. advanced metrics:** The paper doesn't delve into comparisons between traditional and more advanced metrics. It uses established metric suites. 

**30. Generalizability of results:** The paper acknowledges the need for further research with more datasets and projects to confirm the generalizability of the findings.
